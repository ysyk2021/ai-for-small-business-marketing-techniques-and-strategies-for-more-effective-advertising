AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as learning, decision-making, and problem-solving. These systems use algorithms and statistical models to analyze data and make predictions or recommendations based on that data.

There are several types of AI, including:

* Machine learning: This involves training computer systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
* Natural language processing: This involves teaching computer systems to understand and interpret human language.
* Robotics: This involves programming machines to perform physical tasks.
